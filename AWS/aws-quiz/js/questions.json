DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-region replication, in-memory caching, and data export tools.</p>\n\n<p>DynamoDB global tables replicate data automatically across your choice of AWS Regions and automatically scale capacity to accommodate your workloads. With global tables, your globally distributed applications can access data locally in the selected regions to get single-digit millisecond read and write performance. DynamoDB offers active-active cross-region support that is needed for the company.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator</strong> - DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache that delivers fast read performance for your tables at scale by enabling you to use a fully managed in-memory cache. Using DAX, you can improve the read performance of your DynamoDB tables by up to 10 timesâ€”taking the time required for reads from milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per second. DAX does not offer active-active cross-Region configuration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Aurora with multi-master clusters</strong> - Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications. In a multi-master cluster, all DB instances have read/write capability. Aurora is not a NoSQL database, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MYSQL</strong> - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need. RDS is not a NoSQL database, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/features/\">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/features/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-multi-master.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-multi-master.html</a></p>\n",
